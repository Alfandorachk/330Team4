Repository for 330 team 4

Since this is a Java project, I've included all .class files in the exclude
file (.git/info/exclude).  This means those files will not be tracked by
git, so feel free to compile right into this repository if you aren't using
a separate bin folder. 





Some things to help you get started with Git, if you're not familiar:

http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
	-- 	These links will show you how to exclude files.  This will be handy if you
		use an editor that automatically leaves unimportant files around (for
		example, Vim leaves little backup files ending with ~ scattered around)
