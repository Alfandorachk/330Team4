1)	Introduction
	.1:	Document purpose
		

	.2:	System scope
		This system is intended to offer a non-productive alternative to those
		using the intranets of various computer labs, companies, coffehouses,
		conventions, large LAN parties, or wherever an intranet may be.
	
		PRODUCTNAME allows users to chat asynchronously with other users of
		PRODUCTNAME within the confines of the intranet on which PRODUCTNAME
		is installed.  Users may set a profile and link to an e-mail if they
		wish, but this is not required.  Messages posted by a user may be
		viewed by any other user that chooses to look at that first user's
		messages, unless they are marked private, in which case only subscribers
		of the user may view the messages.

		To aid in communication, PRODUCTNAME allows users to mark their
		messages with topics, so that one may browse messages by topic instead
		of by individual user.  This way, even as users sit quietly, staring
		at the glowing portals that transport them to realms of pure logic
		and kittens, users may poll the ever-changing labgeist about
		important topics of the hour, such as why people are wrong to prefer
		Next Gen to Original, or who just farted.

		The client of PRODUCTNAME is the sys-admin on the up-and-up.

	.2:	User characteristics
		The typical user of this system has watched the entirety of telnet
		Star Wars on a Friday night and recalls a glorious time of networks
		that were anti-social, rather than the tittering extroverts they are
		today.
